      Counterparty: <strong>{{counterparty_name}}</strong> (the "Contributor")<br/>
      Effective Date: {{effective_date}}

      Developer note: This agreement is used for employees, founders, executives, contractors, and advisors. Bind via your e-signature flow; store signed PDF in the corporate registry.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>"Confidential Information"</strong> means any non-public information disclosed by or on behalf of the Company, whether oral, visual, written, electronic, or otherwise, including without limitation product plans, designs, software, source code, data, customer lists, pricing, financials, strategies, roadmaps, know-how, trade secrets, and third-party information held in confidence by the Company. Confidential Information includes the existence and terms of this Agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>"Inventions"</strong> means any and all discoveries, developments, works of authorship, designs, methods, processes, formulas, compositions, techniques, databases, mask works, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, and patentable or unpatentable ideas, whether or not reduced to practice.</p>

    <h2>2. Confidentiality Obligations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-use / Non-disclosure.</strong> Contributor shall hold Confidential Information in strict confidence and not use it for any purpose other than performing services or duties for the Company.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard of care.</strong> At least the care Contributor uses to protect its own similar information, and no less than reasonable care.</li>
      <li><strong>Access limitation.</strong> Disclose only to persons who have a need to know for Company purposes and who are bound by obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Mandatory disclosure.</strong> If legally required to disclose, Contributor will, to the extent lawful, promptly notify the Company and cooperate to seek protective treatment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Exclusions</h2>
    <p>Obligations in Section 2 do not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes generally available without breach; (b) was known to Contributor without restriction before disclosure as evidenced by written records; (c) is independently developed without use of Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully received from a third party without duty of confidentiality.</p>

    <h2>4. Return / Deletion</h2>
    <p>Upon the earlier of the Company's request or termination of engagement, Contributor shall promptly cease use of, and return or securely delete, all Confidential Information and Company Property (hardware, credentials, repositories, media) per <strong>Schedule B</strong>, retaining only what is required by law with continuing confidentiality protections.</p>

    <h2>5. Inventions; Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disclosure.</strong> Contributor will promptly disclose to the Company all Inventions that Contributor conceives, reduces to practice, or develops, alone or jointly, in connection with services to the Company, or that relate to the Company's business, R&D, or anticipated products ("<strong>Company Inventions</strong>").</li>
      <li><strong>Work-Made-for-Hire.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Company Inventions are "works made for hire." To the extent not so deemed, Contributor hereby irrevocably assigns to the Company all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to all Company Inventions and all associated IP rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral Rights.</strong> Contributor irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any moral rights (or similar) in Company Inventions, to the extent permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>License Back.</strong> If any Company Invention cannot be assigned by law, Contributor grants the Company an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license (with sublicense rights) to use, reproduce, modify, make derivative works, distribute, perform, display, make, have made, import, and otherwise exploit such Invention.</li>
      <li><strong>Further Assurances.</strong> Contributor will execute documents and take actions reasonably requested to perfect, record, or enforce the Company's rights (both during and after engagement). Company may act as Contributor's attorney-in-fact solely to effect the foregoing if Contributor is unavailable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Prior Inventions</h2>
    <p>Contributor has listed on <strong>Schedule A</strong> all inventions owned or controlled by Contributor prior to engagement that are not assigned to the Company ("<strong>Prior Inventions</strong>"). If no items are listed, Contributor represents there are none. Contributor grants the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any Prior Inventions that are incorporated into Company Inventions or Company products in order to exploit such Company Inventions/products.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Materials & Open Source</h2>
    <p>Contributor shall not incorporate any third-party code, data, or materials subject to terms that would require disclosure of source code or grant of broad licenses (e.g., copyleft open-source) without the Company's prior written approval and compliance with Company policies.</p>

    <h2>8. Conflicts; Non-Solicitation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No conflict.</strong> Contributor represents that performance will not breach any obligation to any former or current employer or third party.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-solicit (12 months post-termination).</strong> Contributor will not directly solicit for employment or engagement any Company employee or contractor with whom Contributor worked, except via public, non-targeted advertisements. {{non_solicit_override_clause}}</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Non-Compete (Optional)</h2>
    <p class="small muted">Use only where enforceable; many jurisdictions restrict non-competes.</p>
    <p>{{non_compete_clause}}</p>

    <h2>10. Data Security & Privacy</h2>
    <p>Contributor will comply with Company security policies and applicable privacy/data protection laws. Credentials are individual, must be protected, and may not be shared. Security incidents must be reported to {{security_contact_email}} within {{security_report_hours}} hours.</p>

    <h2>11. Term; Termination</h2>
    <p>This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues through Contributor's engagement and thereafter with respect to ongoing obligations (confidentiality, non-use, IP assignment, and non-solicitation). Either party may terminate prospectively by written notice; Sections 2–7, 8 (as applicable), 10, 12–15 survive.</p>

    <h2>12. Injunctive Relief</h2>
    <p>Contributor acknowledges that breach may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are inadequate; the Company is entitled to equitable relief (including injunction) in addition to other remedies.</p>
