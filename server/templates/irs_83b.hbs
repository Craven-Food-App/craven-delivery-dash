  <h1>IRS FORM 83(b) ELECTION – INFORMATION & INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

  <p style="text-align:center;">
    Company: <strong>{{company_name}}</strong><br/>
    Recipient: <strong>{{recipient_name}}</strong><br/>
    Equity Grant Date: {{grant_date}}<br/>
    Share Class: {{share_class}} ({{share_type}})<br/>
    Number of Shares: {{share_count}}<br/>
    Price per Share: {{price_per_share}} {{currency}}
  </p>
  <hr/>

  <div class="note small">
    This document provides general information for filing an IRS Section 83(b) election in connection with a restricted stock grant.
    It is not legal or tax advice. The recipient should consult a qualified tax professional before filing.
  </div>

  <h2>1. What is an 83(b) Election?</h2>
  <p>
    Under U.S. tax law (Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), when a person receives stock subject to vesting or other restrictions,
    the IRS generally treats the value of those shares as taxable income only when they vest.
    However, by filing an "83(b) election," the taxpayer elects to be taxed immediately on the value of the shares
    at the time of purchase/grant, rather than later as they vest.
  </p>

  <p>
    For early-stage founders and employees, this often results in significant tax advantages — since the stock value
    at grant is usually very low, future appreciation can then qualify as long-term capital gains instead of ordinary income.
  </p>

  <h2>2. When to File</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must file your 83(b) election with the IRS <strong>within 30 calendar days</strong> of the date the stock was transferred (your grant date).</li>
    <li>This 30-day deadline is absolute — there are no extensions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How to File</h2>
  <p>Follow these steps carefully:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Complete and sign the <strong>83(b) Election Letter</strong> (see attached template below).</li>
    <li>Mail or deliver the signed letter to your local IRS office <strong>within 30 days</strong> of {{grant_date}}. Use certified mail with return receipt requested or a courier with tracking.</li>
    <li>Include a copy of the letter with your federal income tax return for the year of the grant.</li>
    <li>Provide one copy to {{company_name}} for its records (typically to the CFO or HR department).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Where to Send It</h2>
  <p>
    Mail the election to the IRS office that handles your tax return (based on your home address). The IRS maintains a
    <a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/where-to-file-paper-tax-returns-with-or-without-a-payment" target="_blank">list of regional filing addresses</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Example Calculation</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose you receive {{share_count}} shares at ${{price_per_share}} per share on {{grant_date}}. The total value is
    {{total_grant_value}} {{currency}}. You pay {{total_payment}} {{currency}} for the shares. If you file the 83(b) election, you pay
    income tax on the difference (typically zero for par-value shares), and future appreciation is taxed as capital gain.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing the 30-day filing deadline (cannot be fixed later).</li>
    <li>Failing to include a copy with your tax return or to notify the company.</li>
    <li>Listing incorrect share counts, grant dates, or values.</li>
    <li>Assuming this applies to options — 83(b) elections apply only to stock that has been purchased or issued, not unexercised options.</li>
  </ul>
